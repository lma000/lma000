M.S. Computational Biology student at Weill Cornell Medicine in Dr. Jonathan Victor's lab.  
B.S. Mathematics from William & Mary, 2022.  
My research focuses on mathematical analyses of neural activity using two primary approaches; 

- neural circuits: using ODEs/dynamical systems to model and simulate cortical neural circuits and investigating the mechanisms underlying spiking patterns, typically by connecting LIF neurons into a network and quantifying population spike behavior
- spike train metrics: deriving mathematically rigorous distance metrics between representations of spike trains to compare different spike patterns, in particular by embedding spike trains as random walks in $\mathbb{H}^2$ and analyzing endpoints
